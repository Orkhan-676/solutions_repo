Introduction What Are Cosmic Velocities? Cosmic velocities define the speed thresholds required for different types of motion in space. These are: 1. First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity, \\( v_1 \\) ) : The speed required to maintain a stable circular orbit around a celestial body. 2. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity, \\( v_2 \\) ) : The speed needed to escape a celestial body\u2019s gravitational influence. 3. Third Cosmic Velocity (Interplanetary Escape, \\( v_3 \\) ) : The speed required to leave a star system, such as the Solar System. 2. Mathematical Derivations First Cosmic Velocity ( \\( v_1 \\) ) \u2013 Orbital Velocity A satellite in circular orbit experiences a centripetal force equal to the gravitational force: \\[ \\frac{GM}{R^2} = \\frac{v_1^2}{R} \\] Solving for \\( v_1 \\) : \\[ v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}} \\] where: - \\( G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\) m\u00b3/kg/s\u00b2 (gravitational constant), - \\( M \\) is the mass of the celestial body, - \\( R \\) is the orbital radius (distance from the center of mass). Second Cosmic Velocity ( \\( v_2 \\) ) \u2013 Escape Velocity The escape velocity is the minimum speed required to completely leave a celestial body's gravitational pull without further propulsion. It is derived from the energy conservation principle : \\[ \\frac{1}{2} m v_2^2 - \\frac{GMm}{R} = 0 \\] Solving for \\( v_2 \\) : \\[ v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} \\] This is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\) times the first cosmic velocity. Third Cosmic Velocity ( \\( v_3 \\) ) \u2013 Interstellar Escape Velocity To leave the Solar System , a spacecraft must overcome the Sun\u2019s gravity from a given planetary orbit.

Importance in Space Exploration Satellite Launching (First Cosmic Velocity) Satellites require orbital velocity to stay in orbit around Earth. Example: The ISS orbits at ~7.7 km/s . Space Missions (Second Cosmic Velocity) Escape velocity is crucial for sending spacecraft beyond Earth\u2019s gravity. Example: Apollo missions exceeded 11.2 km/s to reach the Moon.

Introduction When a payload is released from a moving rocket near Earth, its trajectory is determined by: - Initial velocity (relative to Earth), - Altitude (distance from Earth's center), - Gravity (attractive force exerted by Earth). Possible trajectories include: 1. Elliptical Orbits ( \\( v < v_2 \\) ): If the payload remains gravitationally bound to Earth. 2. Parabolic Escape ( \\( v = v_2 \\) ): The minimum velocity needed to break free from Earth's gravity. 3. Hyperbolic Trajectory ( \\( v > v_2 \\) ): If the payload completely escapes Earth's gravity. Key Question: How does the payload's initial velocity and release altitude determine whether it remains in orbit, falls back to Earth, or escapes? \ud83d\ude80 2. Theoretical Background Newton's Law of Gravitation The force acting on the payload due to Earth's gravity is: \\[ F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2} \\] where: - \\( G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\) m\u00b3/kg/s\u00b2 (gravitational constant), - \\( M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\) kg (Earth's mass), - \\( r = R_E + h \\) is the payload\u2019s distance from Earth\u2019s center, where \\( R_E = 6.371 \\times 10^6 \\) m (Earth's radius) and \\( h \\) is the altitude. Equations of Motion Newton\u2019s second law gives us: \\[ m \\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{r}}{dt^2} = -\\frac{GMm}{r^2} \\hat{r} \\] which results in a two-body problem that needs numerical integration. Key Velocities: Orbital Velocity ( \\( v_1 \\) ): [ v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} ] The velocity required for a stable circular orbit. Escape Velocity ( \\( v_2 \\) ): [ v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} ] The velocity required to escape Earth's gravitational pull. 3. Computational Simulation We'll use Runge-Kutta numerical integration to simulate payload motion in 2D. 4. Analysis of Trajectories 1. If \\( v < v_1 \\) (Suborbital) \u2192 Payload Falls Back to Earth: - The payload follows a parabolic arc , reaching max altitude before reentering. - Example: Ballistic missiles, suborbital tourism (Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic). 2. If \\( v = v_1 \\) (Circular Orbit) \u2192 Payload Stays in Orbit: - The payload maintains a circular orbit around Earth. - Example: Satellites (ISS, GPS, Starlink). 3. If \\( v_1 < v < v_2 \\) (Elliptical Orbit) \u2192 Payload in a Non-Circular Orbit: - The payload follows an elliptical orbit , returning after each cycle. - Example: Molniya orbits, Hohmann transfer maneuvers. 4. If \\( v = v_2 \\) (Escape Trajectory) \u2192 Payload Leaves Earth: - The payload follows a parabolic trajectory , never returning. - Example: Space probes leaving Earth (Voyager, New Horizons). 5. If \\( v > v_2 \\) (Hyperbolic Escape) \u2192 Payload Leaves with Excess Speed: - The payload follows a hyperbolic trajectory , escaping Earth's gravity. - Example: Interplanetary missions (Mars rovers, Europa Clipper). 5. Real-World Applications 1. Satellite Deployment The right initial velocity and angle ensure satellites enter stable orbits. Low Earth Orbit (LEO): 300-2000 km altitude (ISS, Starlink). Geostationary Orbit (GEO): 35,786 km altitude (Weather satellites). 2. Spacecraft Reentry If a payload loses velocity , it reenters Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Reentry capsules (Soyuz, Dragon, Orion) use heat shields to survive. 3. Interplanetary Missions Escape velocities determine if a spacecraft reaches the Moon, Mars, or beyond. Gravity assists (e.g., slingshot around Jupiter) are used to save fuel. 6. Discussion & Extensions Limitations of the Model Does not include air resistance (important for reentry trajectories). Assumes Earth is a perfect sphere (real gravity varies slightly). No external forces (like solar radiation pressure or thruster burns). Future Extensions Include atmospheric drag for more accurate reentry calculations. Three-body problem (Earth-Moon-Spacecraft interactions). Simulate real mission trajectories (e.g., Apollo, Artemis, SpaceX launches). 7.

Introduction Calculating the equivalent resistance in electrical circuits is a foundational task in physics and electrical engineering. Traditional techniques rely on applying series and parallel reduction rules manually, which becomes cumbersome with complex or nested configurations. Graph theory offers a robust alternative. By modeling a circuit as a graph\u2014nodes as junctions and edges as resistors\u2014we can simplify analysis using algorithms. This enables automation, optimization, and deeper understanding of how networked systems behave. 2. Theoretical Background Graph Representation of Circuits A resistor network can be modeled as an undirected weighted graph : Vertices (nodes) represent junction points. Edges represent resistors. Weights on edges represent resistance values in ohms (\u03a9). Series and Parallel Simplification Series: Two resistors \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) between the same pair of nodes with no branching \u2192 equivalent resistance: $$ R_{\\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 $$ Parallel: Multiple resistors connecting the same two nodes \u2192 $$ \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{eq}}} = \\sum \\frac{1}{R_i} $$ This approach can be applied iteratively until a single equivalent resistance remains between the source and sink nodes. 3. Computational Algorithm Overview We'll develop an algorithm that: Builds a graph from the resistor network. Identifies and simplifies series and parallel patterns.

It is crucial in physics, engineering, and astronomy. One of the simplest yet most effective methods to measure \\( g \\) is through the oscillations of a simple pendulum . By analyzing the pendulum\u2019s period, we can determine the local gravitational acceleration while also exploring the role of uncertainties in experimental measurements. This exercise highlights key concepts in precision, accuracy, and error analysis in experimental physics.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"1%20Physics/7%20Measurements/Problem_1/#procedure","text":"","title":"Procedure"},{"location":"1%20Physics/7%20Measurements/Problem_1/#1-materials-required","text":"A string (1 to 1.5 meters long) A small weight (e.g., keychain, bag of sugar, coins) Stopwatch (or smartphone timer) Ruler or measuring tape","title":"1.
